# Simple Python Projects

This repo is just a collection of some simple Python projects that I worked on for
practice.

## Current Projects

There are currently 4 projects within this repo:

- Quiz Game: Started very basic with just a quiz game about computers.
- Number Guesser: Another pretty basic program that has you guess a number within a user-defined range.
- Math Practice: This is a timed practice test with adjustable difficulty. Made this one for my brother.
- Password Generator: Pretty delf-explanatory; generates a password with user-defined parameters.
